<def> Definition(s):

Insider Trading - Dealing in shares with the advantage of inside information.
The owners of shares in a public company are all supposed to be equal - so if
one of them knows that the company is about to go broke before the others and
sells his shares while their price is still good, that is unfair.  In many
countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., it is also illegal.  However, it
is very difficult to prove that an investor is buying or selling shares on the
basis of inside information.</def>

<smry> Summary:

Document will cite an instance in which the U.S. government propounds two 
conflicting or opposing policies. </smry>


<narr> Narrative:

A relevant document will cite an instance in which the U.S. federal government
propounds two policies which are in conflict with or opposition to each other,
or seem at least hypocritical.  These policies may be cited in the same
document, or in two separate documents within one month's time.  The target is
conflicting policies, NOT a reversal of policy.  Examples of two-faced policy
of interest include: expending funds in the campaign against tobacco use while
subsidizing the U.S. tobacco industry and the marketing of U.S. tobacco
products abroad, allowing imports of produce treated with pesticide which is
banned in the U.S., disapproving the sale of deficient infant formula in the
U.S. while allowing it to be exported to the third world.</narr>

<smry> Summary:

Document will provide quantitative data usable in charting international
crude oil price trends.</smry>


<narr> Narrative:

To be relevant, document must contain international crude oil production and
price data in at least two out of the three following categories: reported
daily output by any member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) or the larger non-OPEC producers (e.g. U.S., USSR, Mexico,
Norway, and Great Britain); the official production quota set by OPEC for any
of its members; and, prices in at least one of the so-called "benchmark" crude
oil markets (specifically, West Texas Intermediate, North Sea Brent, Rotterdam
crude oil spot market, and crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange).  Documents referencing OPEC and its members likely will report or
speculate about political and diplomatic moves related to the "official" OPEC
price, but such information by itself is not directly relevant.  The best
documents would be those which summarize and statistically analyze crude oil
production and price data over a period of time, rather than those which
simply report daily market numbers.</narr>
